# snippet_api
Develop a text saving and retrieval web app using Django. The app should be able to save short text snippets with a title, timestamp and created user. The snippet should also contain a relation to a Tag model (simple model with only title field). Tag title should be unique. Implement JWT authentication for getting user.
